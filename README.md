# KruskalRoadPlanner

### A Road Network Planner using Kruskal's Algorithm

This project uses Kruskal's Algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a road network graph. It generates a random graph, applies Kruskal's algorithm, and outputs the roads to build in order to minimize construction cost.
